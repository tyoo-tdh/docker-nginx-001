        <p>&#8220;Look, I&#8217;ll say it like this though, alright- it&#8217;s a vulnerable time for a lot of these young dudes, you feel me?<br />
        And they don&#8217;t be taking care of their chicken right, you feel me?<br />
        So if they was me, or if I had an opportunity to let these little young sahabs know something, I say:<br />
        &#8216;Take care of y&#8217;all&#8217;s money, African,<br />
        &#8217;cause that shit don&#8217;t last forever&#8217;-<br />
        Now I done been on the other side of retirement and it&#8217;s good<br />
        when you get over there and you can do what the fuck you want to,<br />
        so, I tell y&#8217;all right now while y&#8217;all in it:<br />
        take care of y&#8217;all bread, so when y&#8217;all done you can go ahead and take care of yourself.<br />
        So while y&#8217;all at it right now, take care of y&#8217;all&#8217;s bodies, you know what I mean though,<br />
        take care of y&#8217;all chicken, you feel me though,<br />
        take care of y&#8217;all&#8217;s mentals, y&#8217;all&#8217;s bodies, and y&#8217;all chicken<br />
        so when y&#8217;all ready to walk away<br />
        y&#8217;all walk away and you&#8217;ll be able to do what y&#8217;all want to do.&#8221;</p>
